# Copilot & Agent Contribution Guide

This project is a fullstack template for rapid agentic and human development. Please follow these instructions to contribute effectively, whether you are an AI agent or a human developer.

## 🧑‍💻 For Agents & Contributors

- **Always check official docs before major changes, refactoring, or installing dependencies.**
- **Do not guess—confirm implementation with the current documentation.**
- **Double-check breaking changes or updates** (especially for dependencies in `package.json`).
- **Use clear commit messages** describing your changes for both agents and humans.
- **Write readable code and add comments**—prioritize clarity for future contributors and agentic reasoning.
- **Test CRUD flows after any backend or frontend update** (registration, login, CRUD, etc).
